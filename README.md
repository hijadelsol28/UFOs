# UFOs
## Overview
Dana is requesting an in-depth analysis of a collection of UFO sightings. This project is focused on a table in which a viewer can filter the data based on specific criteria. All was completed using Javascript and HTML/CSS with Bootstrap.

## Results

## Summary
One drawback to the webpage is the long table that requires more scrolling than is convenient. This could be remedied by alimiting 10 data points within the page and adding multiple pages within the HTML site. THe site could also be improved by adding more graphics and/or interactive displays to better captivate a reader's attention.
